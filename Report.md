1. Reflect on how the coding went.  What was easy and what was hard? Did this assignment serve its purpose? Why or why not?
Reflection: This coding assignment was challenging at first because I was still wrapping my head around how recursive lists work. Understanding how nodes reference each other and how recursive calls traverse the list took some trial and error. Once I started to visualize how each function call represented a smaller version of the same problem, things clicked. Writing functions like conditional_str() and filter() helped me see how recursion can replace loops in linked list operations. Overall, the assignment definitely served its purpose â€” it forced me to think recursively and understand how data structures can be manipulated through self-referential logic.
2. Explain how the algorithm for your filter function works.

3. Self-grade: What grade do you think you should receive here?  Why?
